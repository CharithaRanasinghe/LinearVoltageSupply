# LinearVoltageSupply
This is a basic linear voltage regulator supply, capable of providing voltages between 1.2V to applied input voltage. LM317 IC is used to regulate the voltage to the necessary output voltage, adjusted by a potentiometer. An improved version is capable of dimming and indicating voltage using LED.
